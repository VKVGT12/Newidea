    <h3> Subject Of study</h3>
    <p> At the Awesome Science Facultiy&comma;we have a pretty open-minded research faculty &mdash; as long as the subjects fall <br> 
     somewhere in the realm of science and technology&period;u seem like an intelligent&comma; dedicated research&comma;and just <br>
     the kind of person  we'd like to have on our team&period; Saying that &comma; of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigude<br>
    by are as follows&comma;in order of priority&colon;</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine&comma; are the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3&period;)</sub></li>
        <li>Mesuring the effect on the performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F)&comma; when the audience size exponentially <br> increases(effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>&period;)</li>
        <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet"> CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores&period;</li>

    </ol>
    <p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects&comma; including how long you'd expect the <br> research to take&comma; required staff and other resources&comma; and anything else you think we'd need to know &quest; Thanks &period;</p>

     <h3>Exotic dance Moves</h3>
     <p> Yes you are right&excl; As part of my post&minus; doctorate work&comma; I did study exotic tribal dance&period;To answer your questions&comma;<br>my favourite dance are as follows&comma;with definitions</p>
    <p> Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">A little-known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC&comma; a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens&comma; to encourage their livestock to be &quot;fruitful&quot;&period; </p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;"> Before the Icelanders developed file as a means of getting warm&comma;they used to practice this dance&comma;which <br>
     involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor&comma; and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
     tiny &comma; very rapid movements&period; One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern style such as Tweriking&period;</p>
     <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
     <p style="margin-left:20px;"> An interesting example of historic misinformation &comma;English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
     discovered a new dance style characterised by &quot;robotic&quot;&comma;stilted movements&comma;being practiced by inhabitants <br>
    of Northern Alaska and Canada; Later on, however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
    because they were really cold&period;</p>
